Step 1:
Create namespaces for chat,video, etc
Create rooms for each namespaces
Join and leave rooms
Add events!

Step 2:
Incorporate client and test!

Features:
1 - User opens room in namespace (watch and chat!)
2 - Others can join/leave the user's room to get content

LOGIC:
1. On join, check if room exists, if not, create the room with a unique identifier (socket id)
    Emit event to redirect to the room
2. If room exists, join, if says it does and not stored, then error
3. Emit user joined/room created and then log type
